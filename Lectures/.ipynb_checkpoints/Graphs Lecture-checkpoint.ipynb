    "## Definitions\n",
    "A **graph** $G = (V,E)$ consists of a set of **vertices**, V, and a set of **edges**, E. Each edge is a pair $(v,w)$, where $v,w \\in V$. If the pair is ordered, or the matrix of edges is not symmetric, then the graph is directed. A vertex w is **adjacent** to v if and only if $(v,w) \\in E$. In an **undirected** graph if there is an edge $(v,w) \\in E \\rightarrow (w,v) \\in E$, in other words the matrix of edges is symmetric. Sometimes an edge has a third component, known as either a **weight** or **cost** to take it. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **path** in a graph is a sequence of vertices $w_1,w_2,w_3,...,w_n$ such that $(w_i,w_{i+1}) \\in E$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. The **length** of a path is the number of edges on the path, which is equal to $n-1$. We also allow for a vertex to have a path to itself which would be of length 0. This allows for us to define a special kind of edge. If the graph contains an edge $(v,v)$ from a vertex to itself, then the path v,v is referred to as a **loop**. A **simple path** is a path such that all vertices are distinct, except that the first and last vertex could be the same. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **cycle** in a directed graph is a path of length at least 1 such that $w_1 = w_n$. This cycle is simple if the path is simple. For undirected graphs, we require that the edges be distinct. This is defined so that the path u,v,u is not a cycle, because $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ are the same edge. So we define a cycle in an undirected graph a path, $p = w_1,w_2,...,w_n$, where $w_1 = w_n$ and $\\forall(w_i,w_{i+1}) \\in p\\,,(w_{i+1},w_i) \\not\\in p$. However, in a directed graph these are different edges, so the path $p=u,v,u$ such that $(u,v),(v,u) \\in E$. A directed graph is **acyclic** if it has no cycles, we also refer to this graph as a **DAG** (directed acyclic graph). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "An undirected graph is **connected** if there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex. A directed graph with this property is called **strongly connected**. If a directed graph is not strongly connected, but the underlying graph (without directed edges) is connected then it is said to be **weakly connected**. A **complete graph** is a graph in which there is an edge between every pair of vertices. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "An real world example that can be modeled as a graph is a road system. Each intersection is a vertex and each street is a directed edge. You could also associate a cost with each edge being speed limit, distance or time it takes to travel from one intersection to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Representations of Graphs\n",
    "One simple way to represent a graph is to use a two-dimensional array known as an **adjacency matrix**. For each edge $(u,v) \\in E$, we set A\\[u\\]\\[v\\] to 1; otherwise it's 0. If there is a weight associated to the edge we could simply set the value to the weight and for edges that don't exist we could set the weight to $\\infty/-\\infty$ (depending on the problem we are trying to solve) or null. <br>\n",
